# uniduni_t

`uniduni_t` is a Zig library that lets you easily colorize your strings and outputs on your code. It uses ANSI escape codes to put color and styles in your strings and outputs.

It was built with :heart:, as part of my ongoing journey of learning Zig.

## Examples:

### Print with custom foreground, background color and style:
```
```
### Print with main color aliases:
```
```
### Print with RGB color:
```
```
### Reuse your setted colors:
```
```
### Colorize a string:
```
```
### Use uniduni_t on your existing code:
```
```
## TODO:
- Add bright colors
- Add hex colors
- Detect TTY
